Hello Jeff Stewart, and welcome to Throwback Hacks Security!

As I'm sure you've already been informed, you may not have access to your network user account for a few days while IT finishes getting everything setup. In the meantime, you're able to use the Guest Account. You can access the account with the following credentials:

TBSEC_GUEST:WelcomeTBSEC1!

Note: The guest account is heavily monitored and will be deactivated as soon as your account up and running!

Thank you for your patience,

BoJack Horseman,
Information Technology Specailist
